                    <p>Teacher mobile application is a project carried out a few weeks ago, as part of a work on wireframes. The idea is to create an application for teachers, gathering various information on their schedules, their classes or their place of work. <br><br>The first page, the home page lists the main information of the connected teacher. One button offers workplace news and another allows you to quickly search.<br><br>The EDT (timetable) page lists the teacher's schedule, schedules and lessons throughout the year. It is possible to change week and month by pressing the linked button.<br><br>The class section lists all the classes and students of the connected teacher, with for each of them a profile photo that allows the teacher to recognize them. For more convenience, it is possible to sort the students by schedule (either morning group or afternoon group). Finally, a search bar is available to shorten the search time for a class or a student.<br><br>Finally, a note section allows the teacher to fill in the notes and comments of each student. A first page offers him all the subjects / themes he teaches, then the classes he has to note as well as those he has already completed.He can then easily mark a student without making a mistake in class or subject.<br><br> For the moment, this project is only a simple prototype carried out on Figma. To keep a good artistic direction, I made a color palette and listed the different text sizes and fonts on a separate board below.

                    <legend><b>PULV events application</b> üìÖ</legend>
                    <p>PULV events application is my biggest group project currently underway. Today it is only an adobe XD prototype but the objective is to make this project real and available on AppleStore & PlayStore. As a team of 5, we want to develop a mobile application that would list all the events of the associations of the Leonardo da Vinci pole. We want to offer a complete informative and useful content for the visitor who would like to learn or register on an event, as well as a simplified and functional device allowing any administrator member of an association to enter themselves information to pass on new events or other. It is a great project that is close to our hearts.

                    <p>Here is the home page we have designed. This is where the user will be able to see all the next events. For each of them, we see the association and the accepted schools (IIM, EMLV or ESILV), as well as the time, date, meeting place and current hype (the popularity of the event). An event exclusive to IIM will be represented with a small orange circle while an event exclusive to ESILV with a small red circle. For example, the mariokart event displayed is an event of the IIMPACT association which will take place on Friday, October 24 in the 18th arrondissement of Paris. It is exclusive to the IIM and accounts for 247 hypes. <br><br>
                    On the design side, the colors of the menu icons at the bottom are specific to the user's school (orange for the IIM, blue for the EMLV and red for the ESILV). A dark mode is available for everyone's tastes.

If it is part of one or more associations, they will also be displayed here. Finally, a badge system for events has been put in place, which will be obtainable by completing a particular challenge (for example participating in 3 events in a month, etc.). These will be displayed as a gallery of trophies on the user's profile.<br>Finally, an administration system is under development. It would allow an association administrator to provide all the necessary information. Its interface will be different from that of ordinary users, with the "+" section which will allow you to add an event. Any event can be modified and deleted from the home screen by pressing the three small dots.

                    <p>Here is a website project made during my first year at IIM. The objective was to create a site explaining the story of a fictional character. I chose the character of Ken Kaneki from the famous manga Tokyo Ghoul. I had to make several pages, mixing html, css, js and php.
                        Here are some screens of recovered pages. Following a problem, the blog page as well as the login system set up is currently down. This is my first real website after a few months of learning.

By clicking on the red button, we can change the character to the background, transforming him into a ghoule (monster) and making him become a human again. This is one of the main characteristics of Ken Kaneki, half man half ghoule. I decided to play with this aspect there in my site.
